About
----------------

Bookymark is a sample application created for a few reasons:

* Show a sample of my code
* Share an example of CodeIgniter best practices
* Get your pull requests on what are better practices :)
* Practice new techniques
* Simplify as much as possible
* Modularize code into libraries/packages/helpers whenever possible
* Get used to writing tests before writing code
* No deadlines
* No pressure to compete with other services or be successful
* No ever-growing roadmap of features, just the basics
* Eventually port the complete application to other languages and frameworks as an exercise
